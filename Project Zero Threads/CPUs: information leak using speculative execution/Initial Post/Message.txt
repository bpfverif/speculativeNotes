== INTRODUCTION ==
This is a bug report about a CPU security issue that affects
processors by Intel, AMD and (to some extent) ARM.

I have written a PoC for this issue that, when executed in userspace
on an Intel Xeon CPU E5-1650 v3 machine with a modern Linux kernel,
can leak around 2000 bytes per second from Linux kernel memory after a
~4-second startup, in a 4GiB address space window, with the ability to
read from random offsets in that window. The same thing also works on
an AMD PRO A8-9600 R7 machine, although a bit less reliably and slower.

On the Intel CPU, I also have preliminary results that suggest that it
may be possible to leak host memory (which would include memory owned
by other guests) from inside a KVM guest.

The attack doesn't seem to work as well on ARM - perhaps because ARM
CPUs don't perform as much speculative execution because of a
different performance-energy-tradeoff or so?

All PoCs are written against specific processors and will likely
require at least some adjustments before they can run in other
environments, e.g. because of hardcoded timing tresholds.

Apparently our issue tracker can't handle overly long writeups, so I have attached the full writeup as a textfile instead.

This bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. After 90 days elapse
or a patch has been made broadly available, the bug report will become
visible to the public.
